## Folder Setup & Installation

In order to save time time during the session, we recommend that you do the following preparation steps.

* Clone the repository that we will be working with. The link to the repo is located below:

	[https://github.com/dleonhardt/Instructor-Workshop-React](https://github.com/dleonhardt/Instructor-Workshop-React)

* Create a folder called `reactworkshop` separate from this repository that you can use for all of the exercises throughout the lesson.

* If this is the first exercise you are working on, copy the entire contents of the [Unsolved](Unsolved) folder and paste it into your `reactworkshop` folder. Otherwise, you just need to copy and paste the [Unsolved/src](Unsolved/src) folder.

* Since these activities were all built using Create React App all we will need to do is `npm install` once and then copy and paste the `src` folders for each.
	* NOTE: You do NOT need to run Create React App in order to do these exercises. All you will need to do is install the dependencies in the provided node package.json file.

* Install node packages by running the command `npm install` from within the [Unsolved/src](Unsolved/src) folder.

* Stop the dev server if it is already running. Start the app in dev mode by running `npm start`.
