## 1.3 CSS Frameworks

In this activity we are going to install one of the popular CSS Frameworks and utilize their built-in components in an application.

# Instructions

* If you haven't done so already, create a folder called `reactworkshop` separate from this repository that you can use for all of the activities in this repo.

* Copy the entire `src` folder with [Unsolved/src](Unsolved/src) and paste it into your `reactworkshop` folder.

* Install node packages if you haven't done so already by running the command `npm install` from within the [Unsolved/src](Unsolved/src) folder.

* Stop the dev server if it is already running. Start the app in dev mode by running `npm start`.

* Using the starter code in the [Unsolved](Unsolved) folder, install one of the CSS Frameworks of your choice listed below.

	* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/)
