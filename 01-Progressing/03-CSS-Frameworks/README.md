# 1.3 CSS Frameworks

In this activity we are going to install one of the popular CSS Frameworks and utilize their built-in components in an application.

## Folder Setup & Installation

If you have done this in a previous exercise, you may be able to skip some steps below such as the creation of the `reactworkshop` folder.

* Create a folder called `reactworkshop` separate from this repository that you can use for all of the activities throughout the lesson.

* If this is the first exercise you are working on, copy the entire contents of the [Unsolved](Unsolved) folder and paste it into your `reactworkshop` folder. Otherwise, you just need to copy and paste the [Unsolved/src](Unsolved/src) folder.

* Since these activities were all built using Create React App all we will need to do is `npm install` once and then copy and paste the `src` folders for each.

	* NOTE: You do NOT need to run Create React App in order to do these exercises. All you will need to do is install the dependencies in the provided node package.json file.

* Install node packages by running the command `npm install` from within the [reactworkshop/src](reactworkshop/src) folder.

* Stop the dev server if it is already running. Start the app in dev mode by running `npm start`.

## Exercise

* Using the starter code in the [Unsolved](Unsolved) folder, install one of the CSS Frameworks of your choice listed below.

	* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/)

	* [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/)

	* [React-Foundation](https://github.com/digiaonline/react-foundation#install)

	* [React-Materialize](https://github.com/react-materialize/react-materialize#install)

* Follow the directions using the links provided to install the framework.

* Once you've done so, add at least one built-in component your application by using the framework's documentation.

	* Examples: Navbar, Card, Jumbotron, etc.
