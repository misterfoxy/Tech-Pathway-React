# Lesson Plan: @TODO Descriptive and Professional Title

## Overview 

@TODO Write a two or three-sentence overview of the lesson plan.

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `XX-Ins_Demo-Title` through `XX-Stu_Activity-Title`

* @TODO Each Instructor Note block begins with the bullet above, outlining what activities will be covered during class.

* @TODO Empathize with the instructor. If you only had one hour to prepare for class, what are the things you would want to know up front? What are the potential pitfalls in class? Where are students going to get hung up? 

* @TODO Set the instructor up for success.


## Learning Objectives

* @TODO Bullet the learning objectives for the lesson plan. Refer to your Activity Planner.

* @TODO When writing learning objectives, refer to this list of measurable verbs used to assess learning outcomes https://www.clinton.edu/curriculumcommittee/listofmeasurableverbs.cxml

* @TODO For example, "Initialize projects and install third-party packages using npm"

* @TODO If it's a concept and not a demonstrable skill, use "explain". For example, "Explain the client-server model"

* @TODO Don't use "Understand..." as it is not measurable

* @TODO Aim for at least 3 points, but no more than 6. If you find yourself listing more than six points you may need to rethink the scope of your points or the lesson plan itself.
